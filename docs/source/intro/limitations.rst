-------

* It takes time to load when you teleport between different locations. So faster phones may handle the loading better. We are testing on low end specs like `Redmi 5A <https://www.mi.com/in/redmi-5a/>`_ for $75. A parameter to adjust the delays in between teleports and screenshots will most likely be added.
* RemoteGPSController (RGC) is know to sometimes crash follow the below options:
    * Disable Battery Optimization in Settings-> Apps -> RGC -> Battery
    * Go to RGC-Settings (within RGC) and enable OOM Overwrite

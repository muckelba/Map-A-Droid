The walker is the code that will send instructions to your phone and move the walker around with the coordinates that are in the files that is configured in the config.ini. It will also take the screenshots that are then passed to OCR for processing.

The route it walks is visible in MADmin.

To start the walker it is ``python startWalker.py -os``
